= ChallengeLand Javascript7

The hint says "The correct prediction" 

== Solution 

Yes the challenge redirect us to Disney automatically, if you're searching vacations plan then stick with that, if not then lets check what is going on here, for this challenge i will use wireshark to capture the http request to the page where the challenge is alocated, so turn on your wireshark and start listening, open the challenge no matter if you get redirected.

Now stop the wireshark and add a http filter and start looking for some plain text that shows us the source code of the page before redirection.
Now we find the password represented in a few javascript asignation.

Here we have the password and now is time to send it with POST request at the page, so it will solve the challenge. And that's it.

For the last part i add jquery to the console and make the request using ajax with the password.

[source, javascript]
----
var jq = document.createElement('script');
jq.src = "https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.4/jquery.min.js";
document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(jq);
----

After having jquery there i used:
[source, javascript]
----
result = "wonttellya;)"; //Yep wont tell you the password, JUST DO IT
$.ajax({url: "Challenges/Javascript/b7954e6438", method: "POST", data: {answer: result}, success: function(e) { console.log(e) } });
